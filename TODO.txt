TO DO
-----

feature wishlist:

1 hmm topics
2 word alignments
3 cosine similarity
4 discourse new/discoures continuation
5 discourse relations
6 narrative chains (Chambers)



Model 0
replicate barzilay with modern coref
use svm rank
oracle expirment
20 random perms

SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY BETTER


Model 1

run oracle coref
ilp solve for highest scoring entity grid
use weights from svmrank





Model 2

replace svm rank with structured trainer
  train weights by runnin ilp over training data
  
possibly too slow, use lp or prune space
pruning example 
features in dict format
factored edges

Before Model 3

Write up experiment section for models 0-2
tables and stuff :)


Model 3


Question on coref - train on external data or our ordering data (indirectly)
Maybe we can use Berekeley system weights
Train some adjustment parameters

How to embed coref in coherence?

add new features to edges based on berkeley coref paper
small subset of those features (essentialy
