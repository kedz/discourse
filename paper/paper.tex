\section{Introduction}

Automatic coherence assessment has typically examined the effect of local discourse features on coherence. These features are typically sentence-to-sentence transitions of entities, discourse relations, or other sentential information.
Additionally, this task is often framed as selecting the most coherent ordering of a set of sentences in a document, where the original ordering as written by a human is assumed to be the most coherent ordering.
