MALAYLAY , Philippines -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake leveled many villages in the central Philippines before dawn Tuesday and killed at least 44 people , most in a tidal wave .
The quake and surging water also injured 135 people , left eight missing and destroyed as many as 200 homes in villages and nearby towns along the northern coast of the Mindoro Island , said Rodolfo Valencia , one of its two governors .
For Purina Rosales , the nightmare began when the quake leveled her bamboo home at 3:15 am and ended when she found the bodies of Eduardo , her husband , and Alesa , her 4-year-old daughter , hundreds of yards -LRB- meters -RRB- away at dawn .
`` I need you !
I need you ! ''
Mrs. Rosales screamed as she knelt in a one-room schoolhouse where the bodies of Eduardo , Alesa and 13 other people had been placed on benches .
`` Why did n't you use your strength and swim ? ''
she cried to her husband .
Like many of the survivors in the fishing village of Malaylay , Mrs. Rosales grabbed a coconut tree when she was swept away from the rubble of her home , moments after the quake , by amter -LRB- three-foot -RRB- - high tidal wave .
Mindoro already was recovering from a typhoon that struck the area last month , destroying much of the coconut and rice that famrs grow in small fields .
Although the earthquake and one of its 200 aftershocks rocked buildings in Manila and other areas of the Philippines as late at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday , no damage or casualties were reported there .
President Fidel Ramos , who is at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Indonesia , told his government to send the island 's governors 5 million pesos -LRB- dlrs 208,000 -RRB- to help rebuild destroyed homes .
Four military helicopters were rushing food , drinking water and medical supplies to the island .
The earthquake cut off all electricity to the island and destroyed many of its water mains , said Valencia .
The quake had amgnitude of 7.1 and was centered in a strait 10 kilometers -LRB- six miles -RRB- north of the top of the island , said the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology .
Manila , the capital , is 75 miles -LRB- 120 kilometers -RRB- north of the epicenter .
A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area , while magnitude 7 indicates amjor quake capable of widespread , heavy damage .
Ted Sandoval , a specialist at the institute , confirmed that the quake caused a small tidal wave .

CALAPAN , Philippines -LRB- AP -RRB- Hundreds of people who survived a typhoon in their seaside villages last month gave up and fled the area Tuesday after a strong earthquake and a tidal wave destroyed everything they had left on their central Philippine island .
Carrying bags of food and clothing on their heads and shoulders , at least 450 people walked down tar roads with huge cracks left in them by the quake that struck before dawn .
At least 45 people were killed on the northern coast of Mindoro Island , 135 injured and eight left missing , and as many as 200 homes were destroyed , said Rodolfo Valencia , one of its two governors .
Most of the deaths came in the 3-foot -LRB- one-meter -RRB- - tall tidal wave .
Yuji Murata , 41 , a scientist studying orchids for the Japanese government , was trapped by landslides along with three Filipino guides on a 5,000-foot -LRB- 1,525-meter -RRB- mountain , local people said .
The quake struck the island 's Oriental Mindaro province the day it planned to celebrate the 44th anniversary of its founding , and people planning a parade spent the day helping survivors .
When the quake struck at 3:15 am , it was felt throughout the central and southern Philippines and rocked skyscrapers and tall hotels in Manila , 75 miles -LRB- 120 kilometers -RRB- north of the epicenter .
But no damage or injuries were reported very far outside the quake zone .
Throughout the day , several of the 888 aftershocks jarred Mindoro Island again , startling many residents .
`` We are afraid of the sea , '' said Francisca Pascua , 48 , as she walked toward two shelters that were quickly set up in a high school gym and on a hilly field near a hospital in the town of Calapan .
She was with her four daughters and two grandchildren .
Many other shellshocked people also fled Malaylay , the hardest hit village , where at least 25 people died .
For Purina Rosales , the nightmare began there when the quake leveled her bamboo home and the tidal wave struck .
A few hours later , she found the bodies of Eduardo , her husband , and Alesa , her 4-year-old daughter , a long way away .
`` I need you !
I need you ! ''
Mrs. Rosales screamed as she knelt in a one-room schoolhouse where they and 13 other bodies had been placed on benches .
`` Why did n't you use your strength and swim ? ''
she cried to her husband .
Like other survivors in the village of huts and dirt roads , Mrs. Rosales said she grabbed one of the area 's many coconut trees when she was swept away by the tidal wave .
In Malaylay and other fishing villages , several typhoons , including the strongest one last month , had kept many fishermen at home , but none of their homes was destroyed .
That all changed Tuesday with the quake and tidal wave .
President Fidel Ramos , who was at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Indonesia , sent dlrs 208,000 to help rebuild the homes .
Military helicopters also were rushing in food , drinking water and medical supplies .
The earthquake cut off electricity to most of Mindoro Island and destroyed many of its water mains , said Valencia .
The quake had amgnitude of 7.1 and was centered in a strait six miles -LRB- 10 kilometers -RRB- north of the island .
Ted Sandoval , a Filipino seismologist , said the temblor was one of the strongest ever to occur on the active Lubang fault .
A magnitude 6 quake can cause severe damage if centered under a populated area , while magnitude 7 indicates amjor quake capable of widespread , heavy damage .

| With Japan-Earthquake | By CHISAKI WATANABE | Associated Press Writer .
TOKYO -LRB- AP -RRB- When a strong earthquake hits , there are two big fears once the shaking stops : fire and water .
The devastation of earthquakes in Japan is usually compounded by tsunami , or quake-generated tidal waves or by fire .
In Kobe , the western port city battered Tuesday by a violent quake , fires broke out all over the city in the quake 's aftermath .
One conflagration raged unchecked near the city center .
`` The sky above us makes it look like we 're confined under a ceiling of gray smoke , '' Kobe municipal official Tetsuya Watanabe told Nippon TV .
Phone lines were knocked down , making it impossible for many residents to summon firefighters .
And streets were blocked by rubble , hampering the passage of trucks and equipment .
Aftershocks continued to rattle the city , creating the danger of more fires from ruptured gas mains .
`` We are doing our best , but our rescue measures are lagging way behind , '' Watanabe said .
Japan is particularly vulnerable to fire because most Japanese homes do not have central heating and rely on kerosene , gas or electric heaters for wamh .
Quakes can knock them over , setting off blazes .
The great quake of Sept 1 , 1923 , caused 140,000 deaths in Tokyo and nearby Yokohama mostly in the fires .
That quake , with amgnitude of 7.9 , toppled houses and scattered embers from cooking fires , sparking deadly firestorms that swept the capital region 's rickety , densely populated neighborhoods .
In a 1948 quake in Fukui Prefecture , more than 5,000 were killed , with fire again responsible for many deaths .
In Tuesday 's quake , Japan escaped the other big quake danger , tsunami .
Following a quake in 1896 , huge tsunami struck , killing 27,000 people .
Japan has an efficient tsunami-warning system , and residents are quick to heed advice to flee .
But sometimes the warnings ca n't be gotten out quickly enough .
In 1993 , nearly 200 people died in a quake on the northern island of Okushiri , with most of the deaths caused by towering tidal waves up to 100 feet high .
No tsunami warnings were issued following Tuesday 's quake , which was centered in a relatively protected body of water , the Inland Sea .
Tsunami are commonly spawned by Pacific quakes .

BC-Britain-Quake Rescue | With Japan-Quake | British Rescue Teams Flies To Japan To Search For Survivors .
LONDON -LRB- AP -RRB- A 15-strong British rescue team left for Japan Sunday after the government changed its mind and asked for help in finding survivors of Tuesday 's devastating earthquake .
The volunteers from the International Rescue Corps , a British relief agency , plan to use sound location equipment , video probes and thermal imaging cameras to search the ruins of Kobe .
`` We did n't go before because the Japanese government said ` no thanks . '
... We offered our help 30 minutes after the disaster , '' Willie McMartin , the team coordinator , said before boarding a flight to Osaka .
`` It was only on Saturday that they changed their minds and this is the first flight out , '' he said .
McMartin said chances of finding people alive were low , but he noted that earthquake survivors have been found after 11 days .
`` If we are realistic we are looking for ones and twos .
We are not going to find hundreds .
But these one or two people deserve the same chance as the rest .
So we are going to give it our best shot , '' he said .
One of the two interpreters accompanying the 13 trained rescue workers originally came from Kobe .
`` I am not looking forward to going in one way , but I 'm glad that the rescue team decided to go and rescue some of the people I 'm really pleased , '' said Yoko Marsh , who is married to a Briton .

BC-Japan-Quake | Japanese Travel Agency Cancels Quake Tour After Criticism | By JOSEPH COLEMAN | Associated Press Writer .
KOBE , Japan -LRB- AP -RRB- A Japanese travel agency has canceled plans for a 17,000 yen -LRB- dlrs 170 -RRB- tour of areas damaged by Kobe 's earthquake because of strong complaints from quake victims .
The travel agency had planned a four-hour bus tour of devastated areas this weekend , but a report about the tour in the newspaper Mainichi triggered strong criticism and led to its cancellation , the newspaper said .
`` It is sad to have people be shown our broken homes .
It shows a lack of common courtesy toward us , '' the newspaper quoted Junichi Yoshida , 75 , whose house was destroyed by the Jan. 17 quake , as saying .
The Mainichi quoted an official at the travel agency , which it did not name , as saying the purpose of the tour was `` to deepen understanding of anti-disaster steps by seeing the earthquake-stricken area . ''
Part of the fees were to be donated to the victims , it said .
Nearly 190,000 people left homeless by the quake are still living in 541 makeshift relief shelters in Kobe , and thousands of others remain homeless in surrounding areas .
Many people in the shelters have complained about visitors with cameras coming to take pictures of them .
However , there has been remarkably little profiteering from the quake .
Takashi Yamamoto , a T-shirt shop owner , said he agreed only reluctantly to make a batch of T-shirts inscribed `` I survived the quake of 95 '' for a relief group hoping to use them for fund-raising .
`` Everyone was terrified during the quake , so who will want to buy a T-shirt that reminds them of the disaster ? ''
he asked .
`` People will get mad . ''
The death toll reached 5,291 Wednesday , with six people still missing , the National Police Agency said .
A total of 26,815 people suffered injuries .
Critics charge the government was slow in responding to the quake and failed to promptly accept assistance offered by other nations .
In amssage published Wednesday in the International Herald Tribune , Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said the government had not expected such a serious disaster , and had focused initially on rescuing victims instead of replying to aid offers .
Officials estimate the damage from the 7.2 magnitude quake , Japan 's worst natural disaster in more than 70 years , will exceed 10 trillion yen -LRB- dlrs 100 billion -RRB- in Hyogo prefecture , where Kobe is the largest city .
Kobe also expects to lose 96 billion yen -LRB- dlrs 960 million -RRB- in tax revenues about one-third its normal budget in the coming fiscal year because of tax relief for people who lost their homes and the general slowdown in the economy caused by the quake , the newspaper Asahi reported Wednesday .
Reconstruction efforts continued to progress slowly .
Four more public schools opened in Kobe Wednesday , bringing the number holding classes to 256 out of the 345 total .
Some schools were badly damaged by the quake , and many are still being used as emergency shelters for the homeless .
Labor Ministry officials believe more than 10,000 people have become unemployed because of the quake .
Many small companies have been forced to shut down and others have relocated .
The ministry is studying a plan to require that quake victims account for as many as 20 percent of the employees hired by contractors in public works projects in the area , the newspaper Yomiuri reported .

BC-Indonesia-Quake | Strong Earthquake Jolts Irian Jaya .
JAKARTA , Indonesia -LRB- AP -RRB- A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 rocked Indonesia 's easternmost province of Irian Jaya , but there were no immediate reports of damage or casualties , an official said Wednesday .
The quake struck the district of Nabire , 3,130 kilometers -LRB- 1,950 miles -RRB- northeast of Jakarta , at 11:35 p.m. Tuesday -LRB- 1435 GMT -RRB- when most people were asleep , said Suhardjono of the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency .
Its epicenter was about 25 kilometers -LRB- 15 miles -RRB- southwest of Nabire in a densely forested area , said Suhardjono , who like many Indonesians uses only one name .
The quake was also felt as far away as Timika , about 200 kilometers -LRB- 125 miles -RRB- southeast of Nabire , said a district official contacted by telephone .
An earthquake of magnitude 5 is capable of causing considerable damage .
The magnitude measures the total energy released by an earthquake , as indicated by ground motion recorded on seismographs .
An increase of one digit in the scale represents a tenfold increase in the strength of the quake .
In the most devastating earthquake in Indonesia in recent times , a tremor with a 7.5 magnitude killed at least 2,500 people and destroyed thousands of buildings on Flores Island in December 1992 .

BC-Chile-Earthquake ,225 | URGENT | Earthquake Rocks Northern Chile .
WASHINGTON -LRB- AP -RRB- A powerful earthquake followed by two strong aftershocks hit northeastern Chile early Sunday near the city of Antofagasta , the U.S. Geological Survey reported .
The earthquake , which had a preliminary magnitude of 7.8 , happened about 1:11 am EDT -LRB- 0511 GMT -RRB- about 40 kilometers -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- northeast of Antofagasta , a city of about a quarter million people some 1,126.5 kilometers -LRB- 700 miles -RRB- from the national capital Santiago , said Rebecca Phipps , a spokeswoman for the geological survey .
There were no immediate reports on damage or injuries , she said .
The earthquake was followed by a preliminary magnitude 6 aftershock at 1:25 am -LRB- 0525 GMT -RRB- and a preliminary magnitude 6.1 aftershock at 1:47 a.m. -LRB- 0547 GMT -RRB- , the geological survey said .
The magnitude is related to the size of the earthquake fault and the amount the ground slips , as determined by analysis of seismic waves .
The magnitude values differ slightly from those of the Richter scale , which is no longer widely used by seismologists .
The San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , for example , registered an estimated 8.3 on the Richter scale .
Its moment magnitude has been estimated at 7.9 .
An earthquake with amgnitude between 6 and 7 can cause severe damage .
