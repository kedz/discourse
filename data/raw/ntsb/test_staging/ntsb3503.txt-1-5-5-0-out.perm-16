ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-5 The Safety Board prepared a Study of Wake Turbulence Encounter using data from the Boeing 757's flight data recorder, tower communication tapes, and tower reported surface winds.

ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-3 The controller then advised of a 10-knot quartering headwind from the right, issued a wake turbulence precaution, and cleared the student pilot for the landing option. 
ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-4 Witnesses reported that as the student pilot was on final approach, descending through approximately 100-foot altitude (agl), the aircraft abruptly rolled inverted and crashed short of the runway threshold. 
ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-1 While the solo student pilot of the Cessna 152 was on downwind leg for landing, the air traffic controller directed the student's attention to a Boeing 757 aircraft that was preceding the student's aircraft for landing on the parallel runway. 
ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-6 The report concluded that the Cessna 152 descended into the Boeing 757's wake when the wake was 37 to 41 seconds old. 
ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-2 The threshold of the parallel runway is abeam and 500 feet to the right of the runway the student was to land on. 
ntsb3503txt-1-5-5-0-7 The student's flight instructor told the Safety Board that the student, who had 136 hours of dual instruction and 20 hours of solo flight time, had received instruction in wake turbulence avoidance at three points in ground instruction.
