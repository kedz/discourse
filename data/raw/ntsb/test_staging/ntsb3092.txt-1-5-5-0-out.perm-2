ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-12 The ATC handbook stated that certain weather phenomenon may deserve weighted consideration when recommending an emergency airport; the pilot may elect to fly further to an airport with VFR conditions. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-7 Several minutes later Columbus Approach provided a vector back to the initial airport northeast, followed shortly thereafter by a vector to a third airport about 12.5 miles southeast. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-1 The passenger reported that the flight was delayed a day due to weather, and that she was scheduled to attend a class at the destination the day of the accident.

The pilot advised the passenger of icing conditions prior to departure, and reassured her they could deviate if those conditions were encountered. 
ntsb3092txt-1-5-5-0-3 During the flight, in IMC at 9,000 feet, the pilot radioed that he had a partial loss of engine power, and requested vectors to the nearest airport.
