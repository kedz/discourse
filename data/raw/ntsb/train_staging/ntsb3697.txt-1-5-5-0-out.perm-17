ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-6 Allison CEB 1228, issued November 20, 1985, calls for bearings with the ribbon-type, pressed steel separator, to be replaced with bearings that incorporate a one-piece machined steel separator. 
ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-4 The balls were ejected into the gear case and one was ingested by the oil pump, which caused internal jamming and the resultant shearing of the splined adapter which drives the oil pump.

ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-3 The aft bearing (gear case cover) of the FCU/oil pump drive spur gear had disintegrated due to failure of the ribbon-type ball separator, which was found in the bottom of the gearbox in two pieces and deformed. 
ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-5 The ball separator was manufactured from an austenitic stainless steel, instead of AISI 1010 as specified by the manufacturer, and the material exceeded allowable hardness specifications. 
ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-8 The mechanic reported that he had replaced the number 2.5 bearing and the spur adapter gear shaft 265 hours and 4 months before the accident, which would have provided access to the gearbox to accomplish the bulletin. 
ntsb3697txt-1-5-5-0-1 The pilot experienced a partial loss of engine power while established in an out of ground effect hover at 150 feet agl and landed hard in the resulting autorotation.
