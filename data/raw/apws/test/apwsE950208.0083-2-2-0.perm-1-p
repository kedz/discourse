apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 KOBE, Japan (AP) A Japanese travel agency has canceled plans for a 17,000 yen (dlrs 170) tour of areas damaged by Kobe's earthquake because of strong complaints from quake victims. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The travel agency had planned a four-hour bus tour of devastated areas this weekend, but a report about the tour in the newspaper Mainichi triggered strong criticism and led to its cancellation, the newspaper said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``It is sad to have people be shown our broken homes. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 It shows a lack of common courtesy toward us,'' the newspaper quoted Junichi Yoshida, 75, whose house was destroyed by the Jan. 17 quake, as saying. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The Mainichi quoted an official at the travel agency, which it did not name, as saying the purpose of the tour was ``to deepen understanding of anti-disaster steps by seeing the earthquake-stricken area.'' 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Part of the fees were to be donated to the victims, it said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Nearly 190,000 people left homeless by the quake are still living in 541 makeshift relief shelters in Kobe, and thousands of others remain homeless in surrounding areas. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Many people in the shelters have complained about visitors with cameras coming to take pictures of them. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 However, there has been remarkably little profiteering from the quake. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Takashi Yamamoto, a T-shirt shop owner, said he agreed only reluctantly to make a batch of T-shirts inscribed ``I survived the quake of 95'' for a relief group hoping to use them for fund-raising. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``Everyone was terrified during the quake, so who will want to buy a T-shirt that reminds them of the disaster?'' he asked. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``People will get mad.'' 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The death toll reached 5,291 Wednesday, with six people still missing, the National Police Agency said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 A total of 26,815 people suffered injuries. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Critics charge the government was slow in responding to the quake and failed to promptly accept assistance offered by other nations. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 In amssage published Wednesday in the International Herald Tribune, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said the government had not expected such a serious disaster, and had focused initially on rescuing victims instead of replying to aid offers. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Officials estimate the damage from the 7.2 magnitude quake, Japan's worst natural disaster in more than 70 years, will exceed 10 trillion yen (dlrs 100 billion) in Hyogo prefecture, where Kobe is the largest city. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Kobe also expects to lose 96 billion yen (dlrs 960 million) in tax revenues about one-third its normal budget in the coming fiscal year because of tax relief for people who lost their homes and the general slowdown in the economy caused by the quake, the newspaper Asahi reported Wednesday. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Reconstruction efforts continued to progress slowly. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Four more public schools opened in Kobe Wednesday, bringing the number holding classes to 256 out of the 345 total. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Some schools were badly damaged by the quake, and many are still being used as emergency shelters for the homeless. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Labor Ministry officials believe more than 10,000 people have become unemployed because of the quake. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Many small companies have been forced to shut down and others have relocated. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The ministry is studying a plan to require that quake victims account for as many as 20 percent of the employees hired by contractors in public works projects in the area, the newspaper Yomiuri reported.
