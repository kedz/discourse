apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The volunteers from the International Rescue Corps, a British relief agency, plan to use sound location equipment, video probes and thermal imaging cameras to search the ruins of Kobe.

apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 We offered our help 30 minutes after the disaster,'' Willie McMartin, the team coordinator, said before boarding a flight to Osaka. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``It was only on Saturday that they changed their minds and this is the first flight out,'' he said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 McMartin said chances of finding people alive were low, but he noted that earthquake survivors have been found after 11 days. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``If we are realistic we are looking for ones and twos. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 We are not going to find hundreds. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 But these one or two people deserve the same chance as the rest. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 So we are going to give it our best shot,'' he said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 One of the two interpreters accompanying the 13 trained rescue workers originally came from Kobe. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 ``I am not looking forward to going in one way, but I'm glad that the rescue team decided to go and rescue some of the people I'm really pleased,'' said Yoko Marsh, who is married to a Briton.
