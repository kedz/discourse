apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 WASHINGTON (AP) A powerful earthquake followed by two strong aftershocks hit northeastern Chile early Sunday near the city of Antofagasta, the U.S. Geological Survey reported. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The earthquake, which had a preliminary magnitude of 7.8, happened about 1:11 am EDT (0511 GMT) about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northeast of Antofagasta, a city of about a quarter million people some 1,126.5 kilometers (700 miles) from the national capital Santiago, said Rebecca Phipps, a spokeswoman for the geological survey. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 There were no immediate reports on damage or injuries, she said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The earthquake was followed by a preliminary magnitude 6 aftershock at 1:25 am (0525 GMT) and a preliminary magnitude 6.1 aftershock at 1:47 a.m. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 (0547 GMT), the geological survey said. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The magnitude is related to the size of the earthquake fault and the amount the ground slips, as determined by analysis of seismic waves. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The magnitude values differ slightly from those of the Richter scale, which is no longer widely used by seismologists. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, for example, registered an estimated 8.3 on the Richter scale. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 Its moment magnitude has been estimated at 7.9. 
apwsE9511250054-2-2-1 An earthquake with amgnitude between 6 and 7 can cause severe damage.
